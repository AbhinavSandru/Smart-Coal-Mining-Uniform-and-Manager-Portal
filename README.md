# Smart-Coal-Mining-Uniform-and-Manager-Portal

This project is about creating smart uniforms for mining workers for increased safety. As part of this, various sensors are embedded in to the uniform.These sensors securely transmit data to managers about hazardous conditions like methane levels, CO2 levels, etc., and the workersâ€™ physical conditions like O2 levels, Heart Rate, etc., improving overall safety of the mining worker.
